## Project information
***Category:*** Deep Learning 

**Programming Language:** Python

***Tools & Libraries:*** Keras, Tensorflow

***Front End:*** Python â€“ Tkinter

**Back End:** Python

**Prerequisites:** Python, Machine Learning


### ***What is it ?***   
The handwritten digit recognition is the ability of computers to recognize human handwritten digits. It is a hard task for the machine because handwritten digits are not perfect and can be made with many different flavors. The handwritten digit recognition is the solution to this problem which uses the image of a digit and recognizes the digit present in the image.

  
### ***About the Python Project***   

In this Python project, we are going to implement a handwritten digit recognition app using the MNIST dataset. We will be using a special type of deep neural network that is Convolutional Neural Networks. In the end, we are going to build a GUI in which you can draw the digit and recognize it straight away.
The interface is created by using **Tkinter**.


***Prerequisites***  
The interesting Python project requires you to have basic knowledge of Python programming, deep learning with Keras library and the Tkinter library for building GUI.  

Install the necessary libraries for this project using this command: `pip install numpy, tensorflow, keras, pillow`



### Project structure :  
The project will have the following structure:
* `digit_classifier.h5` : the final model
* `Digits Classification with CNN` : a notebook where we will use a neural network Classifier CNN (from keras) to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST database.
* `Digits Classification with RNN` : a notebook where we will use a neural network Classifier RNN (from keras) to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST database.
* `Handwritten Digit Recognition` : the app notebook to reconize Handwritten Digit
