### **About the Python Project**   
In this project, we will build a model to detect whether a person is wearing mask in real-time. We will do this using the concepts of computer vision using the OpenCV library and Keras



## Project information
**Programming Language:** Python

**Category:** Deep Learning, Machine Learning, Computer Vision

***Front End:*** Python â€“ Tkinter

**Back End:** Python

**Prerequisites:** Python, Deep Learning, Machine Learning

**Domain:** healthcare



### ***The Dataset***  

Face Mask Data
The dataset consists of 1376 images with 
- 690 images containing images of people wearing masks and 
- 686 images with people without masks.
 
It is an excellent dataset for people who want to try learning techniques of deep learning for face mask detection.
